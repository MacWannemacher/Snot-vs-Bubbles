## Background

	Little Timothy was bored in class one day when he started to scetch in his notebook. 
He was drawing some cartoon faces and a spaceship in his notebook, when they suddenly came to life
right on the paper. Now it's up to you to control the ship and shoot down those cartoons. 

### How to Play

Movement
	To move your ship,use the arrow keys to move left, right, up, and down.
Shooting
	Press the space bar to fire your bubble gun. 
Clear all the bad guys to win the game but be careful, the back line has two lives.
